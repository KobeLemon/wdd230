  index.html:
    1. I did not have a header tag yet so I moved the div #profilebox containing my name & profile into a new header tag.

    2. The <a href=""> anchor tags for Lessons 2-11 were empty & threw an error on the accessibility validator so I removed all empty anchor tags and replaced each of them with a comment to remind myself to add the anchor tag back when I finish each assignment.
    
    3. the paragraph tags #currentyear & #date were tripping the HTML validator because they had no text content so I added the text FILLER TEXT so it passed the validator and the JavaScript will overwrite that text anyway.
    
    4. the <p> tags #currentyear and #date were tripping the accessibility validator because they were large so they should have been heading tags but were just paragraph tags so I replaced the <p> tags with <h3> tags and left them at the normal <h3> size, then that passed the accessibility validator.


  style.css:
    1. I changed the background-color of the window background to rgb(255,255,240), background-color of the header & footer to rgb(0,0,108), & background-color of the title & list items to rgb(54,129,84).

    2. I changed the font color of all text to white and also added a hover effect to the anchor tags so the background-color becomes the same as the window background & the link text turns blue.

    3. I centered everything on the page & made it width limited.

    4. I adjusted minor styling on a few things here and there to make everything look better.
